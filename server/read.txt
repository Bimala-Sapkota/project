 1. virtual dom in react means 
In React, a virtual DOM (also known as a virtual node tree) is a lightweight in-memory
representation of the real DOM. It's a tree-like data structure that mirrors the structure of the real
DOM, but with some key differences.


2. how it work
The virtual DOM is created and updated by React when the state of the application changes. When the
state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM representation of the application, and then compares
it with the previous virtual DOM representation. If there are any differences, React updates the real DOM
to match the new virtual DOM representation.


3. why it is useful
The virtual DOM is useful because it allows React to optimize the rendering of the application by only
updating the parts of the real DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire application.


4. how it is implemented
The virtual DOM is implemented using a combination of JavaScript objects and a library called
`react-dom`. The `react-dom` library provides the functionality for creating and updating the virtual DOM
and for rendering the virtual DOM to the real DOM.

5. what are the benefits of using virtual dom in react
The benefits of using the virtual DOM in react are:
*   **Faster rendering**: The virtual DOM allows React to optimize the rendering of the application by
only updating the parts of the real DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entir
*   **Improved performance**: By only updating the parts of the real DOM that have changed, th
*   **Simplified debugging**: The virtual DOM makes it easier to debug the application by providing a
*   **Better support for dynamic updates**: The virtual DOM allows React to handle dynamic updates
*   **Improved support for server-side rendering**: The virtual DOM makes it easier to render the
*   **Improved support for code splitting**: The virtual DOM makes it easier to split the code into
*   **Improved support for hot reloading**: The virtual DOM makes it easier to reload the code without
*   **Improved support for code optimization**: The virtual DOM makes it easier to optimize the code


6. what are the challenges of using virtual dom in react
The challenges of using the virtual DOM in React are:
*   **Steep learning curve**: The virtual DOM can be difficult to understand and work with,
*   **Performance overhead**: The virtual DOM can introduce a performance overhead, especially
*   **Debugging complexity**: The virtual DOM can make debugging more complex, especially when
*   **Server-side rendering complexity**: The virtual DOM can make server-side rendering more complex,


7. recontiliation //virtual dom
Reconciliation is the process of comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updating the real DOM to
match the virtual DOM. This process is done by React when the state of the application changes.



8. diffing algorithm
The diffing algorithm is a key component of the virtual DOM. It's a process that compares th
virtual DOM with the real DOM and determines what changes need to be made to the real DOM to match
virtual DOM.

 9. virtual dom
 The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. It's a tree-like data
 structure that represents the UI components and their relationships.


 react 
 react is a javascript library for building user interfaces. it allows you to create reusable UI components and manage
  the state of your application. react is a view library, not a full-fledged framework,
 it doesn't handle routing, state management, or server-side rendering out of the box. react is
 used for building user interfaces and is often used in conjunction with other libraries and frameworks such as
 react-router, redux, and next.js.

 jss
 jss is a css-in-js solution for react. it allows you to write css code in your
 javascript files and automatically generates the corresponding css code. jss is a popular choice for
 react applications because it allows you to write css code in a more modular and reusable way.



component in react
A component in React is a small, reusable piece of code that represents a UI element or a group
of UI elements. Components can be thought of as functions that return JSX elements. They can be used
to build complex UIs by combining smaller components together.

eg:
const Greet = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to home page</h1>

      <p>this is first react component</p>
    </div>
  );
};

DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a
tree-like data structure. The DOM is used by web browsers to render web pages and by web developers
to manipulate the structure and content of web pages.



SPA
single page application
SPA is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates that page as the user interacts
with the application. SPAs are typically built using client-side rendering and do not require a full pag
reload when the user navigates between different parts of the application.






props
props is short for properties. it is a way to pass data from a parent component to a child
component in react. props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are passed to a child
component.



hook
hook is a function in react that allows you to use state and other react features without having to
subclass a component. hooks are used to manage state and side effects in functional components.

watch is a function in react that allows you to watch for changes to a value and run a function
when the value changes. watch is typically used in conjunction with the useState hook to watch for changes to
state.
